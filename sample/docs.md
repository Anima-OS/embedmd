# A hello world in Go

Go is very simple, here you can see a whole "hello, world" program.

[embed.md]:# (hello.go)

You always start with a `package` statement like:

[embed.md]:# (hello.go /pack/)

Followed by an `import` statement:

[embed.md]:# (hello.go /import/ /\)/)

And finall, the `main` function:

[embed.md]:# (hello.go /func main/ //)
